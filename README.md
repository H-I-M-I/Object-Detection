**Object Detection Project**  

This project demonstrates object detection using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub. The implementation leverages pre-trained models to detect and classify objects in images. Below are the techniques, tools, and logical steps employed:  

### **Techniques:**  
- **Pre-trained Models:** Utilizes state-of-the-art models such as:
  - SSD MobileNet V2: Efficient object detection with lower computational cost.
  - Faster R-CNN Inception ResNet V2: High-accuracy detection for complex scenes.  
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and class labels on the images.  

### **Tools:**  
- **TensorFlow 2.x:** Core library for model loading and inference.  
- **TensorFlow Hub:** For downloading and loading pre-trained object detection modules.  
- **Pillow (PIL):** Image manipulation, including drawing bounding boxes and labels.  
- **NumPy:** Array manipulation for preprocessing and output handling.  
- **Matplotlib:** Visualization of images with detected objects.  

### **Logic:**  
1. **Model Loading:** The pre-trained object detection model is loaded from TensorFlow Hub.  
2. **Image Preparation:** Images are downloaded or loaded locally and preprocessed into a format suitable for the model.  
3. **Inference:** Object detection is performed on the input image using the loaded model.  
4. **Post-processing:** Model outputs are decoded to extract class labels, bounding box coordinates, and confidence scores.  
5. **Visualization:** The detected objects are drawn on the original image using bounding boxes and labels.  

### **Features:**  
- Efficient and accurate object detection.  
- Option to switch between models based on performance needs.  
- GPU-accelerated inference for faster results (if GPU is available).  
- Clear visual representation of detected objects.  

This project is ideal for understanding how to apply pre-trained object detection models in real-world scenarios.
